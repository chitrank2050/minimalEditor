##Functions

   1.Press of an enter key enters a new para. <br/><br/>
   2.Users can enter links in the text editor by using tags. For example, “<a>This is a link </a>”. When the user clicks “Done”, the editor should detect if the user has entered a link tag in the editor. If so, add that text as an actual link (like this: This is a link (http://www.google.com/)) to the bottom of the page (outside of the text editor). The links at the bottom of the page should be colored red and blue alternatively, and they do not need to actually link to another site.<br/>
   3.On double-clicking a word or by selecting a word, show a tooltip with three options: make the word bold, underlined, and change the text color to Red.<br/>
   4.Replace all the four letter words on your page with the random words generated by using http://randomword.setgetgo.com/. If the original word was styled, then the new word replacing it should also be styled in the same way<br/>
